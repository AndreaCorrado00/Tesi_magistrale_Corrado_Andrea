function show_filter_pipeline_didactical(type)
% This function demonstrates the application of signal processing techniques 
% for denoising ECG signals. Depending on the selected 'type', it loads different 
% ECG signal datasets, applies pre-processing, and then evaluates the performance 
% of wavelet-based and bandpass filtering methods. The results are visualized 
% through plots showing the noisy signal and filtered signals over time.
%
% Parameters:
%   type (string): Specifies the type of ECG signal to process. Valid options are:
%       - "high_frequency_ecg": ECG signal with high-frequency noise.
%       - "Low_frequency_ecg": ECG signal with low-frequency noise.
%       - "PhysioNet_healthy": ECG signal from a healthy subject in the PhysioNet database.
%       - "PhysioNet_Pathological": ECG signal from a pathological subject in the PhysioNet database.
%
% This function loads the necessary ECG dataset, processes the signal based on 
% the selected type, and visualizes the results of different filtering techniques 
% (wavelet thresholding and bandpass filtering).
